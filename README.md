gesture drawing app

A very quickly thrown together gesture drawing app.

install uvicorn and fastapi with pip

make a directory in the same location called "save"

change the default directory in the server.py file

then start the server with start_server.py

open http://localhost:8123/ in your browser.

the seconds and directory setting in the top right shown in the screen shot is hidden until you hover over it.

key bindings:

->:             Next (random) image
<-:             Previous image
Space or P:     pause
S:              save to the "save" directory
